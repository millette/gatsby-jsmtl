An elegant solution may be found in Model-Driven Engineering. In particular, Statecharts, a formalism for describing complex, reactive, timed, state-based behaviour, is highly suited to model UI behaviour. This presentation will discuss the SCXML JavaScript Code Generation Framework (scxml-js), a Statechart-to-JavaScript compiler, and how it may be used to accelerate the development of fast, robust, and richly interactive Web-based UIs","links":[{"url":"http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/gsoc/2010/scxml-js/","title":"SCXML-JS"},{"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram","title":"State Diagrams @ Wikipedia"}]},{"title":"Building real-time web applications with CouchDB","name":"Alexis Sellier","url":"http://cloudhead.io/","email":"alexis@cloudhead.net","synopsis":"Alexis is going to introduce <a href=\"http://couchdb.org\">CouchDB</a> and explain how he's been using it to create real-time web applications.","links":[{"url":"http://couchdb.org","title":"CouchDB"},{"url":"http://thingler.com","title":"Thingler"}]}],"blurb":"After a short hiatus we return with two great presentations.
