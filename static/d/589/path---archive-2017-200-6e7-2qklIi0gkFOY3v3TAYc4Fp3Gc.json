Unfortunately, it used to require PhantomJS or browsers configured with virtual displays (like Xvfb) that made it fairly difficult and time-consuming. This has recently been made much simpler with Chrome supporting \"headless mode\", and with Google creating the npm package Puppeteer it is even simpler. Now the Chrome browser can be remotely controlled with just a few lines of Javascript code. I will show you some useful hands-on code examples.","links":[{"url":"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome","title":"Chrome Headless"},{"url":"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer","title":"Puppeteer"}]},{"title":"Introduction to Progressive Web Apps","name":"Sylvain Hamann","url":"sylvhama@gmail.com","email":"sylvhama@gmail.com","synopsis":"As we know, responsive web sites are no longer enough.
